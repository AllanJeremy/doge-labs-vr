## Friend Request System: Initiator and Receiver

In our friend request system, we use the concepts of **initiator** and **receiver** to manage the friendship process. This approach helps maintain clarity and control over the friend request lifecycle.

### Initiator

- The **initiator** is the user who sends the friend request.
- Represented by the `userId` field in the `userFriends` table.
- Has the ability to cancel the friend request before it's accepted.

### Receiver

- The **receiver** is the user who receives the friend request.
- Represented by the `friendUserId` field in the `userFriends` table.
- Has the power to accept or reject the friend request.

### Logical Flow

1. **Sending a request**:

   - Initiator sends a request ‚Üí Creates a new entry in `userFriends` table
   - `isConfirmed` is set to `false`

2. **Accepting a request**:

   - Receiver accepts ‚Üí Updates `isConfirmed` to `true`
   - Both users are now friends

3. **Rejecting/Cancelling a request**:

   - Receiver can reject or Initiator can cancel ‚Üí Deletes the entry from `userFriends` table

4. **Removing a friend**:
   - Either user can remove the friendship ‚Üí Deletes the entry from `userFriends` table

This system ensures that:

- Friend requests have a clear direction
- Only the receiver can confirm a request
- Both users have control over their friendships

Remember these concepts when working with the friend request functionality in the codebase!
